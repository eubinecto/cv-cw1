## Task 1
### What's
> What does it mean to perform "convolution" on an image with "structuring element"?

THat means to reduce the image into a smaller one, while maintaining certain features of the image.

For example,
any examples from the lectures?


> What should be the size of the filter?

Use a 3 by 3 filter.


### Why's
> Why do I want to perform a convolution on `kitty.bmp`? 

To extract some features? Yes. If you look at the description for task 2:
- compute the "horizontal and vertical gradient images"
- find the "edge strength image", given by the gradient magnitude


> Why do we pad the image? 

Because otherwise, the image won't be a square...?



### How's
> The convolution algorithm from scratch?

> The padding algorithm from scratch?
